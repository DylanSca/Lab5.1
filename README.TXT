TechSupport - the DodgySoft Technical support system.

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is discussed in chapter 6.

This project aims to implements a technical support system for customers of 
the DodgySoft software company. Users can describe their software problems and 
get advice instantly!

The idea is based on Eliza - a famous program described by Joseph Weizenbaum 
in 1966. (Do a web search for "Eliza" and "Weizenbaum" if you want to know 
more about this.)

In fact, it is much more primitive than Eliza. But that's enough to match the 
quality of many software companies' technical support advice...  ;-)

To start this program, create a SupportSystem object and execute the "start" 
method.

Then start describing your problem by typing in the terminal window.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate and study library classes, such 
as ArrayList, HashMap, HashSet, and Random.

This project is only a first, rudimentary step towards the full solution.

Answersssss***********

1. Class docs have sections like description, constructors, methods, and fields to explain how the class works.

2. startsWith checks if a string starts with something; one starts at the beginning, the other at a set index.

3. Yes, endsWith(String suffix) checks if a string ends with something.

4. Yes, length() gives the number of characters, no parameters.

5. I found them in the String class docs; it’s easy since methods are listed clearly.

6. public String trim() removes spaces at the start and end, like text.trim();.

7.
